\section{Introduction}

Among computer applications, video games occupy a special spot.
In contrast to many other software applications, they are almost
exclusively used in a leisure context.
In contrast to consuming media like video (movies, series) and
audio (music, audio books), they are also interactive.
Also, in contrast to the production of movies and the like, video game
production is accessible not only to big studios, but even to lone
enthusiasts, resulting in a very large available catalog of video games.
To complement, there are nicely-working integrated digital distribution
and sales platforms.
