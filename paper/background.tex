\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

This section reviews the current hardware and software platforms
for different types of gaming, introduces utility metrics for games,
and describes the data sources used for the evaluations in this paper.
All costs are from an European, specifically German, perspective. If a
product is not available in this region, the prices are converted using
the most recent currency exchange rates.
Note that as mentioned before, browser and mobile games are out
of scope for this work.

\subsection{Gaming Hardware}

\subsubsection{Gaming \acrshort{PC}s}
Hardware viable for \gls{PC} gaming starts at about $\text{\texteuro} 500$ but
has practically no upper limit for enthusiasts. The \gls{GPU}
is a cost driver, and it is essential for modern \gls{PC} gaming.
This poses a certain financial barrier for customers to start \gls{PC} gaming,
which is however compensated by an increased flexibility and longevity of
hardware.

\subsubsection{Video Game Consoles}
Dedicated consoles represent the classical approach to video gaming.
The price for (non-portable) consoles varies but usually lies between
$\text{\texteuro} 300$ and $\text{\texteuro} 400$ for the latest console
generation, i.e., \textit{Switch}, \textit{PlayStation 4}, and
\textit{Xbox One}.
While priced lower than \glspl{PC}, console hardware is not componentized
and not upgradeable as easily.

\subsubsection{Cloud Gaming Hardware}
One of the main claimed benefits of \gls{cg} is its low requirements
on end user hardware. Thus, a less powerful \gls{PC} may suffice to
use a \gls{cg} service as long as the network connection to the
service provides an adequate latency and bandwidth.
Sony's \psnow \gls{cg} service was originally available only for their
PlayStation 3 and 4 consoles, and a line of their TV sets. The latter
option has since been removed, and streaming to \glspl{PC} enabled
instead.

Companies also experiment with devices that focus exclusively on streaming
\gls{cg} content. The only standalone game streaming device currently
in the market is NVIDIA's \textit{SHIELD} which starts at
$\text{\texteuro} 230$ and is bound to their \gls{cg} service, \gfnow.

Here, too, a stream-to-\gls{PC} option has become available recently
(as a US-only beta programme).

\subsection{Gaming Ecosystems}
Below, currently active (cloud and non-cloud) gaming platforms are examined
with regards to pricing models and hardware requirements and costs. The
information presented was collected between July 2015 and February 2016.
\todo[inline]{Und was auch immer sonst noch.}

\subsubsection{\gls{PC} Gaming: Something for everyone}
\label{sec:pcgaming}

The rise of easy-to-use digital distribution platforms and the
independent (``indie'') game scene reinvigorated \gls{PC} gaming just a few
years ago. Today, \gls{PC} gaming is dominated by large digital marketplaces,
with \steam being the largest. The platform has about $10$ million
concurrent users at most times of the day. It periodically offers large,
often seasonal, sales of recent games at greatly reduced prices (rebates
of 75\% for a year-old game are not uncommon). In addition, many
resellers offer digital codes for other platforms, often at much lower
prices.
% Alternative storefronts, entirely independent from \steam, also exist, such as \textit{GOG}\footnote{\url{https://www.gog.com/}}.%, and enrich the competition even more.
Major releases on PC are usually priced between $\text{\texteuro} 50$
and $\text{\texteuro} 60$. However, due to the competition between the
vendors, the digital retail prices are significantly lower even at
launch, and also drop more quickly. Another recent trend are game
bundles, which especially prevalent in the indie games scene, commonly
offered with a pay-what-you-want model. \textit{Humble
Bundle}\footnote{\url{https://www.humblebundle.com/}} is a prominent
example.

\subsubsection{Video Game Consoles}

New, major game releases are mostly priced at either
$\text{\texteuro} 60$ or $\text{\texteuro} 70$. Once on the market, the
game prices decrease rather slowly. In recent years, retail stores have
been complemented with console-specific, proprietary digital
distribution services that also offer the latest game at the full price.
These official stores are usually exclusive vendors for digital game
codes where competitors are excluded.

%, meaning that there will be no competition that quickly reduces prices.
Subscription fees often apply for the multiplayer mode of games, e.g.,
\textit{PlayStation Plus} or \textit{Xbox Live Gold} with annual prices
of $\text{\texteuro} 50$ and $\text{\texteuro} 60$, respectively. These
services also include access to a small, monthly changing palette of
older titles.

% generally offer a monthly rotating palette of (older or smaller) game titles included in the subscription.



\subsubsection{\Gls{cg} Ecosystems}

\todo[inline]{Warum beschreiben wir genau die?}

NVIDIA's \gls{cg} platform%\footnote{\url{https://shield.nvidia.com/games/geforce-now}}
\gfnow
is available in North America and select European countries.
In Germany the service currently offers $68$ PC titles
for a monthly subscription fee of $\text{\texteuro} 10$. An additional
per-game one-time fee between $\text{\texteuro} 13$ and
$\text{\texteuro} 60$ is charged for the access to the $19$ most
prominent and recent games. The service is delivered from six
specialized data center locations (Dublin and Frankfurt in Europe).

The requirements to use this service are rather steep, demanding
\SI{50}{\mega\bit\per\second} for a full
1080p60 stream\footnote{\label{foot:rate}Please note: This frame rate of
\SI{60}{\hertz} represents the rate of the video encoder and not the
game's actual frame rate, which might be considerably lower depending on
the complexity of the game.} (\SI{10}{\mega\bit\per\second} in
order to use the service at all) and a maximum \acrshort{RTT} of
\SI{60}{\milli\second} to one of the data centers. In addition,
streaming is exclusive to \textit{SHIELD} devices which start at
$\text{\texteuro} 200$.

% Started in parts of Europe in Q4/2015

\psnow, Sony's cloud gaming service, offers to stream titles from previous
PlayStation generations, as the latest console generation lacks
backwards compatibility. It is currently available in North America and
the UK, with a closed beta running in other European countries and
Japan. The offered titles and exact pricing vary from country to
country. For the UK, about $190$ titles are available, and most titles
are covered by the monthly subscription fee of about $\text{\texteuro}
17$. All titles are also available through a separate rental service,
costing about $\text{\texteuro} 4$ for \SI{48}{\hour} and
$\text{\texteuro} 10$ for one month of access. This is in addition for
the device cost, as the service is only available on PlayStation 4 and 3
consoles as well as some select Sony TVs and other devices with extra
game controller.

%(which would however necessitate the purchase of a game controller).

The streaming itself is performed at a resolution of
720p60\cref{foot:rate} requiring a \SI{5}{\mega\bit\per\second}
connection. Reports on the video quality have been rather
mixed.\footnote{\url{http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2015-hands-on-with-playstation-now}}
% Sony is also reportedly using specialized server hardware, adapted from regular PlayStation 3s, effectively eliminating any chance for multi-purpose uses of these devices. This could lower scalability gains.

\subsection{Utility Metrics}




\subsection{Datasets}
In order to investigate game characteristics, data was collected from
multiple sources and merged (with a few instances of omission and
double-count) into a data base. In the interest of repeatability and
reproducibility, all of the data reported on in this work, as well as
the code used to collect and process it, can be found in public
repositories\footnote{The main repository can be found at
\url{https://github.com/mas-ude/cost-of-cloud-gaming}}.
Data were joined on game names and platforms (where appropriate).
The different data sources are described in the following.

For \steam, the public \acrshort{REST} \acrshort{API} was used to
fetch the name and current price of each game at three different points in
time\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mas-ude/steam-data-stats}}. This
data was combined with \acrshort{API} data from the 3rd-party site
\textit{SteamSpy}\footnote{\url{https://steamspy.com}}, which parses all
publicly visible \steam user profiles and
estimates statistics on the size of the player base and the time each
player spends with a title. \textit{SteamSpy} also provides a heuristic
projection of the total number of owners of each listed title on \steam.
For \gfnow, game names and prices were screen-scraped manually.
Game names for \psnow is available from their website\footnote{\url{https://www.playstation.com/de-de/explore/playstation-now/ps-now-games/}}.
\todo[inline]{What about \psnow prices then?}
Through this, the portfolios can be compared between platforms.


Game publishers are usually secretive about the intended playthrough
length of games (nor do all games necessarily have one). However, players
may self-report their experienced playthrough times on sites like
\hltb\footnote{\url{http://howlongtobeat.com/}}, which was web-scraped
for this analysis using a custom tool\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mas-ude/gamelengths-scraper}}.

%Reported times are separated into different play styles, e.g., ``main story'' for players that just finish the main objectives of a game, or ``completionist'' for those who explore the game to the fullest extent. Only an aggregate time over all reports per play style is shown for every game. (For our analysis, we average over all play styles for every game.) %It should however be stressed again, that this is a self-reporting site without strong validity checks, which has to be considered when contemplating the accuracy of the data.

Lastly, the age of a game is computable from its release date. To this end, the
\metacritic\footnote{\url{http://www.metacritic.com/}} page which
aggregates reviews of video games (and other media) was
scraped\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mas-ude/metacritic_scraper}}.
