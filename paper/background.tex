\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

This section aims to cover all basic information on Cloud Gaming and their business models. It also briefly introduces the employed datasets.

\subsection{Service Costs of Gaming Platforms}

To evaluate the costs and benefits of individual gaming platforms, one should first take a look at the vastly different price models --- as well as the supporting competitive ecosystem surrounding them --- these services offer to their customers. For this investigation only currently active services, Cloud and otherwise, are examined which narrows the number of services considerable. The information presented here was collected in February 2016 and is subject to change. All costs shown here are from an European, specifically German, perspective. If a product is not available in this region, the prices are converted accordingly to the current exchange rates.



\paragraph{Video Game Consoles}

One of the classical approaches to video games is using dedicated consoles with physical copies of a game bought at a retailer. The prices for (stationary) consoles varies but usually lies between \SI{300}[\EUR] and \SI{400}[\EUR] for the latest console generation, i.e. currently \textit{Wii U}, \textit{PlayStation 4}, and \textit{Xbox One}. New, major game releases are mostly priced at either \SI{60}[\EUR] or \SI{70}[\EUR]. The decline in price is rather slow for individual console games, often only happening over the course of several years.

In recent years retail stores have been more and more complemented with each console's proprietary digital distribution service, also the latest game at the full price. These official stores are usually the only vendor for digital game codes, meaning that there will be no competition that quickly reduces prices. 

In order to utilize a game's multiplayer component, some services require you to opt in to a subscription, dubbed, e.g. \textit{PlayStation Plus} or \textit{Xbox Live Gold}, with annual prices of \SI{50}[\EUR] and \SI{60}[\EUR] respectively. These services do however generally offer a monthly rotating palette of (older or smaller) game titles included in the subscription.

\paragraph{Verkehrsvolumen}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Internetanbindung?
	\item Caching of basic resources is probably not applicable?
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Serverlaufzeiten}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Energie
	\item Verschleiß
	\item Wartungs- und Betriebspersonal oder Anmietung
	\item Frage: Rechnet sich Anmietung von Ressourcen bei großen generischen Rechenzentren? Annahme nein, da man selbst ein großer Anbieter wäre u. die Margin wegfallen. Auf der anderen Seite gibt es Hardware die für Games im Serverbereich besser skalieren? Wenn ja, kann umso mehr kein generischer Anbieter die Lösung sein
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Spiele-Lizenzen und -Adaptionskosten (?)}
Modelannahme: Kosten pro Nutzung (realistisch eher in Blöcken verrechnet)

\subsection{Data}

The leading question for the user side of the cost-benefit analysis is: ``How can we properly estimate the value a user gets from a specific service?'' with an additional question of ``What is the definition of value in this context?''

Simply counting the number of games one gets for a specific amount of money may be the easiest value metric but may also fall short. Therefore, this paper evaluates further approaches that also take game lengths and press review scores into account.

In order to achieve this, data had to be collected from various sources and merged into a consistent data base. All the scraping and merging code as well as the data itself can be found in the repositories at TODO to be verified by third parties. The following sections describe the individual data sources.

%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Steam API + SteamSpy Datensätze+Graphen}

Steam Sales:
Large seasonal sales (christmas, summer, lunar new year, halloween, fall, spring, ...) of many/most games on the platform usually rebates of 50\% and up.
Weekly sales
Daily sales
Weekend sales
Free weekends



\url{https://github.com/mas-ude/steam-data-stats} Steam + SteamSpy REST API Datensammler + ein paar Graphplotter (und eher ergebnislose Clustering-Versuche); für sinnvolle Analsyen müsste man dazu aber viel häufiger Datensätze generieren. Beispielausgaben:

CDF der Preise auf Steam (Juli ‘15) \ref{fig:steam-prices}

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{images/steam-prices.pdf}
	\caption{CDF of games on the steam platform at two distinct dates.}
\label{fig:steam-prices}
\end{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{images/steam-cost-vs-playtime.pdf}
	\caption{Violin plot of the average playtime (as recorded by SteamSpy) of games categorized by their prices.}
\label{fig:steam-cost-vs-playtime-violin}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{HowLongToBeat Data}

Data scraped from \url{howlongtobeat.com}. This site allows for manual reporting of playthrough times of games on any platform. Times are separated into different play styles (e.g. ``main story'', ``completionist'') and only an aggregated time is shown. For this analysis only the average playtime of all play styles is taken into account.
It should however be stressed again, that this is a self-reporting site without strong validity checks. This has to be considered when contemplating the accuracy and validity of the data.

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{images/gamelengths-density.pdf}
	\caption{Density plot of the average game lengths over all play styles.}
\label{fig:gamelengths-density}
\end{figure}

Nonetheless, the distribution of game lengths from this set can still be worth to look at in the context of putting value to games for consumers of different platforms. As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:gamelengths-density} the play lengths vary greatly, with the median at \SI{7.5}{\hour} and a long tail of long play times reaching \SI{420}{\hour}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Metacritic Data}

Game lengths can not only serve as an indicator of the amount of content a game has to offer, but can also serve as an engagement metric to estimate a user's amount of satisfaction. More fitting engagement metrics could also be employed.

% TODO: include or compare with data from opencritic.com as soon as their API is public/usable
