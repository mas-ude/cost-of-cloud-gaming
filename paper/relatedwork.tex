\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}

As this work aims to investigate Cloud Gaming services, several lines of research are touched. 
First, work that deals with operational benefits of Cloud Gaming and cloud services in general. This also encompasses energy consumption issues.
And second, literature covering \gls{QoE} aspects of gaming in general and Cloud Gaming in particular. These reflect the users' quality expectations but can also outline the requirement for a service's operation.

% Area 1:
% Operational, energy and business investigations and issues
% of cloud, gaming, cloud gaming, especially focus on mobile cloud gaming and device energy preservation

% Area 2:
% QoS/QoE in gaming literature is also relevant as it impacts service quality as well as gives requirements for service operation

\subsection{Operational and Efficiency Factors}

Unfortunately, many publications on Cloud Gaming only concern themselves with the client's side often even looking at just mobile Cloud Gaming. For example \cite{Soliman2013} overviews some general issues of mobile cloud gaming. Several other publications, e.g. \cite{6924295} and \cite{Huang:2014:MCP:2755535.2755542} investigate the client device's energy saving potential of mobile Cloud Gaming but find rather marginal energy savings.


``Cloud gaming: a green solution to massive multiplayer online games'' \cite{6882299}
(TODO: need to read the full text yet)
Argues that removing computation intense tasks from (mobile) user devices leads to overall energy savings

``Placing Virtual Machines to Optimize Cloud Gaming Experience'' \cite{6853364}
latter paper includes many server cost optimization parameters, that might be worth looking at

Looking at more general work...


Also approaches that select (and cost-optimize the selection of) data-centers might not be applicable due to the stringent latency and BW requirements and the need for dedicated hardware (GPUs) and the statefulness of gaming, e.g.
``QoS-Aware, Cost-Efficient Selection of Cloud Data Centers'' \cite{6740249}
``Cost-efficient Capacitation of Cloud Data Centers for QoS-aware Multimedia Service Provision.'' \cite{hans2014cost} optimization to geographically clustered users


Another optimization TODO: read fulltext

\subsection{Gaming QoS/QoE}

Trifecta of quality influencer:

Concept of end-to-end lag, even in offline games especially in cloud games. No opportunity for lag compensation techniques in cloud games. Needs to be kept as low as possible (ergo the need for regional data centers)

sufficiently high image quality of the stream (no noticeable loss of quality compared to local game, even for ``difficult''games with complex scenes or with much noise). Ergo also demand for high throughput for both the data center as well as the user (ideally 15-30Mbit/s per stream)
but also adequately chosen graphical settings; trade-off between resource demands and visual fidelity


sufficiently high frame rate; stuttering; interactivity; but also end-to-end lag influencer, see also \cite{metzger16lagmodel}.

% client-side costs (monetary, energy, latency) of mobile devices; however underestimates energy costs in comparison to local gaming, display is the biggest factor, which is not factored in (this factor is also the same in local as well as cloud gaming); the monetary cost factor also underestimates the contractual situation in countries like Germany
% And despite all this, it still finds mobile cloud gaming rather unfeasible (except in WiFi)

% ``Where Did My Battery Go? Quantifying the Energy Consumption of Cloud Gaming'' \cite{6924295}
% Similar notion as previous paper, more in-depth, focus only on energy costs
% test impl of local running game artificially increases cpu/gpu load
% especially for low load games only marginal energy savings for cloud approach (~12\%)
% even best case (and unrealistically high load) only 38\% energy savings
% considering all the other drawbacks that cloud streaming incurs, this might not be enough
