Recently, and very much in line with this paper, the \acrshort{ITU-T}
published recommendation G.1032~\cite{mollertowards, itutg1032}, dealing with
influence factors on gaming \gls{QoE}.
The recommendation emphasizes that gaming \gls{QoE} depends on multiple
influence factors, several of which this paper studies,
particularly the category of context influence factors.
The recommendation lists these factors,
but does not evaluate them. This paper does so, both through a survey
among video gamers (for subjective factors) and a study of
game platforms (for objective factors).

Literature on video game \gls{QoE} is often based on
direct measurements of game and network parameters. However, the
rich variety of video game contents makes it difficult to generalize
the results. This paper's attempt to better understand said variety,
and the consumers' views of it, is thus an endeavor to support future
research into video game and gaming \gls{QoE}.
%On itself, this paper does not provide quality-related studies on gameplay.
Work supporting this view \cite{7965676,7503835} analyzed single specific
games from different genres and different game sub-scenarios within
them, complementing \acrshort{MOS} value studies with questionnaire-based
assessments of delay detection, quality acceptance, difficulty,
annoyance etc.

Research efforts of the past were often centered around network \acrshort{QoS}, e.g. on the network delay component of the \gls{E2E} lag for both online games and cloud gaming. The results, however, remain inconclusive. Past studies of multiplayer games also often focused on a single genre, namely \glspl{FPS}, with titles such as \textit{Quake 3}~\cite{1266180} or \textit{Unreal Tournament 2003}~\cite{Beigbeder:2004:ELL:1016540.1016556}. Concerning cloud gaming, Chen et al.~\cite{6670099} find very high and variable delay values even when neglecting the network delay. Furthermore, \cite{Choy:2012:BSC:2501560.2501563} gives some insights on the delay requirements of streamed games and the implications for data center distance as well as placement.
Image quality represents a further \gls{QoE} factor. Gaming adds
another dimension to typical image quality assessments, as most
games allow for changes to their graphical fidelity.
%, be it either the resolution or more demanding graphical features, such as ambient occlusion or anti-aliasing. Cloud gaming usually locks these options at one specific setting for a specific quality-to-resource-demand trade-off, resulting in an often lower source quality than what local games can offer.
As an example, the work in \cite{slivarimpact} takes a look at different encoding parameters for cloud gaming. %, but does unfortunately not conduct a full-reference analysis nor investigates the impact of the coding latency.
An overview of some further \gls{QoE} taxonomy and influence factors especially for mobile games is given in \cite{beyer2014typedisplaydelayimpact}.
%Several efforts~\cite{Jarschel20132883,6614351} also set up
%subjective tests of cloud gaming services with specific \gls{QoS}
%parameters in mind.

For video streaming applications, \gls{QoE} context
monitoring and context-based \gls{QoE} management has proven to be
worthwhile~\cite{7140480}. The factors are grouped by
their source, i.e. the gamer, the hardware/software/network system,
and the context (including the gamer's social embedding, novelty,
and game service factors).
