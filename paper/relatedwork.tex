\section{Cost of Cloud Gaming}

``Mobile Cloud Gaming: Issues and Challenges'' \cite{Soliman2013}
short overview of some possible issues

``Will Mobile Cloud Gaming Work? Findings on Latency, Energy, and Cost'' \cite{Lampe:2013:MCG:2514943.2515398}
client-side costs (monetary, energy, latency) of mobile devices; however underestimates energy costs in comparison to local gaming, display is the biggest factor, which is not factored in (this factor is also the same in local as well as cloud gaming); the monetary cost factor also underestimates the contractual situation in countries like Germany
And despite all this, it still finds mobile cloud gaming rather unfeasible (except in WiFi)

``Where Did My Battery Go? Quantifying the Energy Consumption of Cloud Gaming'' \cite{6924295}
Similar notion as previous paper, more in-depth, focus only on energy costs
test impl of local running game artificially increases cpu/gpu load
especially for low load games only marginal energy savings for cloud approach (~12\%)
even best case (and unrealistically high load) only 38\% energy savings
considering all the other drawbacks that cloud streaming incurs, this might not be enough

``Measuring the Client Performance and Energy Consumption in Mobile Cloud Gaming'' \cite{Huang:2014:MCP:2755535.2755542}
Similar findings, only 30\% energy savings


``Cloud gaming: a green solution to massive multiplayer online games'' \cite{6882299}
(TODO: need to read the full text yet)
Argues that removing computation intense tasks from (mobile) user devices leads to overall energy savings


Also approaches that select (and cost-optimize the selection of) data-centers might not be applicable due to the stringent latency and BW requirements and the need for dedicated hardware (GPUs) and the statefulness of gaming, e.g.
``QoS-Aware, Cost-Efficient Selection of Cloud Data Centers'' \cite{6740249}
``Cost-efficient Capacitation of Cloud Data Centers for QoS-aware Multimedia Service Provision.'' \cite{hans2014cost} optimization to geographically clustered users
``Placing Virtual Machines to Optimize Cloud Gaming Experience'' \cite{6853364}
latter paper includes many server cost optimization parameters, that might be worth looking at

Another optimization TODO: read fulltext
