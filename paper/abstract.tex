In recent years, cloud gaming has become a popular research topic, and
the list of its supposed benefits is long. However, cloud gaming
platforms are still waiting for the commercial breakthrough. This might
be caused by the pricing models and product offerings by existing ``à la
carte'' platforms. This paper aims at investigating the costs and
benefits of both platform types through a twofold approach. We first
take on the perspective of the customers, and investigate several cloud
gaming platforms and their pricing models in comparison to the costs of
``à la carte'' platforms. Then, we explore engagement metrics in order
to assess the enjoyment of playing the offered games. Lastly, coming
from the perspective of the service providers, we aim to identify
challenges in cost-effectively operating a large-scale cloud gaming
service while maintaining high \acrshort{QoE} values. Our analysis
provides initial, yet still comprehensive reasons and models for the
prospects of cloud gaming in a highly competitive market.
