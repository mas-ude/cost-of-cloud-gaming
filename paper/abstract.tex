\begin{abstract}

Video games have firmly reached the mainstream and have become
a multi-billion dollar industry.
This paper presents two views on the current state of this
large and evolving market:
First, it explores questions related to user experience and motivation
through an online survey taken by almost 500 participants from all
over the world. This reveals their subjective valuation of characteristics
offered by today's gaming platforms.
Second, the paper evaluates a large dataset of objective metrics for
various gaming platforms: game lists, playthrough lengths, prices, etc.,
and contrasts these metrics against the gamers' opinions.
