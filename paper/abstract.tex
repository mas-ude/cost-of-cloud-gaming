The recently published \acrshort{ITU-T} Recommendation G1.032
proposes a list of factors that may influence cloud and online

This paper provides two practical evaluations of system and
context influence factors proposed:
First, it investigates through an online survey ($n=488$) the popularity
of platforms, preferred ways of distribution, and motivational aspects
including subjective valuations of characteristics offered by today's
prevalent gaming platforms.
Second, the paper evaluates a large dataset of objective metrics for
various gaming platforms: game lists, playthrough lengths, prices, etc.,
and contrasts these metrics against the gamers' opinions.
