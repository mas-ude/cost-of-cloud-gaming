In recent years, \gls{cg} has become a popular research topic, and
the list of its supposed benefits is long. However, cloud gaming
platforms are still waiting for the commercial breakthrough. This might
be caused by the pricing models and product offerings by existing ``Ã  la
carte'' platforms. This paper aims at investigating the costs and
benefits of both platform types. Based on a multi-platform dataset
that spans the last two years, utility metrics for the platforms
are discussed. A cost utility model is then developed to
make the pricing policies of different offers comparable.
The analyses presented
provide an initial, yet still comprehensive insight for the
prospects of \gls{cg} in a highly competitive market.
