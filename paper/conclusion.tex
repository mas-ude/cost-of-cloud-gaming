\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

While cloud gaming is a topic of strong interest, it comes with a series of problems and limitations, both of technical and economic nature. With the conducted user-side analysis the curated nature of current cloud gaming services becomes apparent, which entails a narrow offer of hand-selected games and sometimes even a narrow target group (see the case of \psnow). This naturally limits the value of a subscription-based service model for customers, when insufficient convenience and price advantages can be yielded.

But also the operator-side reveals major problems due to the need for highly regional data-centers and special hardware. This eliminates any chance for the efficiency gains that general cloud services are intended for. Moreover, subscription-based models suffer from the expected higher peak utilisation in comparison to Ã  la carte game purchasing models, which creates a high cost pressure due to enormous infrastructure investments and limited scaling advantages. 

However, there might be some niches for specific games or audiences that could be sustained at reduced operational efforts. This might be an angle worth of investigation in the future, especially with better engagement metrics and more detailed models of gaming data center operations.

\todo[inline]{PZ: But you still have to have the hardware? Isn't that just a niche variant of conventional gaming?}
However, there might also be a simpler and economically more feasible alternative to cloud gaming: game streaming in the local network, which would combine the open market structures of conventional gaming platforms with the ease of use of having a small box in the living that one just can play games on without much thought to the underlying hardware.
