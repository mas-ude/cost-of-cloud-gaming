\section{platform-market-comparison/games-per-year.R}

 hat den ersten Versuch einer Nutzenrechnung für Spieler auf verschiedenen Plattformen. Script könnte leicht angepasst und erweitert werden. Beispielausgabe \ref{fig:gamesperyear-over-budget}, \ref{fig:steam-prices}

\section{E2E Lag}
End-to-End Lag Model and Simulation in R. Now a standalone (submitted) paper at \url{https://github.com/mas-ude/onlinegame-lag-sim}. Can be referenced to argue the need for low E2E lag (meaning low network delay, but also the need for high fps).

\section{Other Useful Data for Model Creation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Game costs (current cost possible via Steam dataset; historic price data more difficult)
	\item Length of games (either via howlongtobeat dataset (via \url{https://github.com/mas-ude/gamelengths-scraper}), SteamSpy data, or could also additionally manually parse more Steam data)
	\item Gaming score/ratings/rankings (via Metacritic dataset (via \url{https://github.com/mas-ude/metacritic_scraper}), or might want to additionally scrape steam user review scores)
	\item Other popularity measures? (e.g. steamspy owner data?)
	\item Influence of E2E lag on games? (could be theorized indirectly through e2e lag sim + categorization attempts)
	\item Hardware requirements of games?

	\item Price History? Maybe using steamdb.info?
\end{itemize}
