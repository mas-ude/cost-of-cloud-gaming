## script intended to look at the reverse model of games-per-year.R:
# assume a fixed number of games
# (maybe even certain individual games: a selection of recent popular titles for that timeframe (via e.g. metacritic))
# and then calculate the cost for each individual service platform

# TODO: update games-per-year.R first
