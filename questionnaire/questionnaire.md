 Welcome and thank you for participating in this study!

We are researching gaming platforms and their offers, and want to complement the data we gathered with your opinions on various issues related to gaming systems, purchases, motivations, user experience and so on. Please answer the questions without looking up your personal gaming stats. It's perfectly fine if you only have rough estimates off the top of your head.

The study will take approximately 5-10 minutes of your time. All gathered data will be handled anonymously and will only be used for scientific purposes. You do not have to answer questions which could reveal your identity.

If you have any questions concerning this questionnaire, please feel free to contact: Svenja Schröder M.Sc.

Thank you very much for your participation!
