Notes

The online survey can hopefully complement the "objective" API etc. data; we can also think about asking other questions besides the users' perception of platform offers.

Format of the lists below: question --- reasoning behind posing the question

    How often do you start playing new games? --- Is novelty an important factor for a platform?
    List the last X games you bought recently.
    Can we see you Steam (et al.) stats? --- Provides ground truth for the answers of individuals.
    Which types of controllers do you use? --- Input method as the technical basis for in-game interaction quality
    How do you customize your controller? --- key bindings etc.
    Rate the install / startup / patching... time / frequency of your favorite game. --- Explore other interactions besides actual gameplay.
    Rate the effort required to set up your favorite game before you could first play it.
    Rate the effort required to launch into your favorite game after you have already set it up.
    Which online stores do you use? --- Win 10 store offers "cross-play" so that games are available across devices (?)
    Do you care about $PLATFORM_METRIC? --- Check the users' points of view of the game platform utility metrics we proposed in the ex-MMB'18 paper.

Rough ideas we could also consider

    .... --- Ask about genres and game/gamer classifications
    .... --- "Die Cloud-Gaming-Warteschlange"
    .... --- Quality of Game Shopping Experience
    .... --- Hardware, frame rates, (graphics) quality
    .... --- Bundles, subscriptions
    .... --- replayability (collectibles, Steam Achievements, completionists)
