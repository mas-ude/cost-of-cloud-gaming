Help us find out your gaming motivations (for science)!

Dear /r/ Community!

My Name is Svenja Schr√∂der. I am a PhD student at the University of Vienna in Austria. Together with my colleagues I'm trying to have a deeper look on motivations and buying behavior regarding video games.

We've already gathered "objective" data in the form of Steam, HLTB and Metacritic statistics, which we now want to complement with "subjective" data by *you* (the gaming community) with an online questionnaire (you won't be surprised what comes next...).

With this post we'd like to invite you to participate in our 5-10 minute long online questionnaire regarding your motivations and buying behavior: https://www.soscisurvey.de/univie-cosy-gaming/

All data is handled absolutely anonymously and is only used for research purposes. ANNOUNCEMENT: At some point late in the questionnaire we ask you for your Steam ID, which deanonymizes your data, at least for us. You absolutely don't have to provide your ID, but this helps us to connect subjective with objective data. You absolutely don't have to provide this information to us (it's an optional field)! I'm being so upfront so that there's hopefully no misunderstanding oder surprise. :)

Thank you and have a very good day!

Svenja from UNIVIE


TL;DR: We're doing an online survey regarding motivations in video gaming. Please help us out!
