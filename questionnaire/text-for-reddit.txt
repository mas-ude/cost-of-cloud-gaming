Dear /r/ Community!

My Name is Svenja Schr√∂der. I am a PhD student at the University of Vienna in Austria. Together with my colleagues Dr. Albert Rafetseder and Dr. Florian Metzger we're trying to have a deeper look on motivations and preferences regarding video games in the gaming community.

We've already gathered "objective" data (see: XXX, link, what did we already do with it...), which we now want to complement with your "subjective" data by the means of an online questionnaire (you know what comes now...).

With this post we'd like to invite you to participate in our 5-10 minute long online questionnaire: https://www.soscisurvey.de/univie-cosy-gaming/

(The topic of our work is ...)




Thank you and have a very good day!

Svenja from UNIVIE


TL;DR: We're doing an online survey regarding motivations in video gaming. Please help us out!
