List of parameters that impact the QoE of a game and may be essential to classify games.

Quality of Eperience in a Gaming Session on User Level is based on:

- Expectation of User (based on players experience and promises that are made by the game) -> User parameters important

QoS:

'Game' (not focus)

- Sound Quality
- Story
- Athmosphere
- Gameplay
- Individualizability (i.e. FOV Sliders, Colour blind mode)
- game pace (turn-based, real-time, fast, slow)

Social (not focus)

- Teamwork, Friendliness (i.e. friends, trolls)
- perceived Fairness (i.e. Balance, Luck)
- 'Self-Novelty' (i.e. skins)

Player Performance

- Winning/Losing
- perceived self-improvement
- Beating a challenge (i.e. High performance)

Technical

- Resolution / Graphical Fidelity
- Network Delay / Total Delay (ms)
- Synchronization among players (ms)
- Frequency of 'Interruptions' (1/s) i.e. loading screen
- Length of 'Interruptions' (s)
- Frame rate (1/s) impacts delay
- Tick rate (1/s) impacts synchronization and delay


Interesting to Research:

Impact of (Network QoS x Game) on Applications QoS.
Impact of Application QoS on QoE.


Technical Dimensions of Games that impact the QoS (We focus on Technical and Performance)

- required reaction time (ms)
? Accuracy and precision of input actions (i.e. cursor movement speed)
? frequency of actions (1/s) APM
? camera perspective that may be chosen by the player
? 'Genre'
